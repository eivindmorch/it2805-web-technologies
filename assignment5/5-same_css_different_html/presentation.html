			<h3>Personal life</h3>
			<p> My name is Eivind and i'm 22 years old! I grew up in Oslo in a family of four.  
			In my spare time I put a lot of time and effort into sports, such as cycling, bandy, running and weight lifting. Other than that I enjoy going out with friends, however, i'm also a big fan of spending the night on the sofa or in front of the computer. At the end of the summer of 2012 I moved to Trondheim to start on my bachelor's degree in Informatics.</p>

			
			<h3>My life at <abbr title="Norwegian University of Science and Technology"> NTNU</abbr> </h3>
			<p> During the two years I have been here, I have learned a lot about computer architecture, programming, networks and project planning. There is still a lot to learn, and I'm looking forward to the projects ahead of me. I have not yet decided on which of the Master's degrees i want to take, although i'm currently leaning towards either Data- and information management and Intelligent systems.  </p>
